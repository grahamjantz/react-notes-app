### Things I took away from this project:
 
My goal in doing this project was to gain a better understanding of React components interacting. In this tutorial Chris shows how a child component can change the state of the parent component by passing the function down through the children components to the desired location.
 
This project also introduced me to function components and hooks. I have only learned about class components thus far but I was able to understand the use of function components. The use of hooks (useState and useEffect) are still rather new to me but I look forward to learning more about these!
 
This project also provided some clarity in dividing an app into components and which pieces should go into each component.
 
Although this tutorial was not comprehensive on everything React, I am thankful for Chris' efforts and his ability to make such a high quality tutorial!
 
### Issues:
 
In Chris' working app the notes are saved to local storage and can be retrieved by the user upon refresh. I was unable to implement this feature, but as my goal here was to gain better understanding of interacting components I was not terribly concerned about this feature.
